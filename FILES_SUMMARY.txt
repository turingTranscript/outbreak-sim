HOW TO USE THIS PACKAGE
================================================================================

STEP 1: Read Documentation
   Start with: 00_START_HERE.md (2 min)
   
STEP 2: Run Locally
   bash:
   $ npm install
   $ npm start
   
   Opens at http://localhost:3000

STEP 3: Test the Simulation
   - Click Play button
   - Watch for ~30 generations
   - See red dots (drug-resistant) appear and spread
   - Experiment with parameter sliders

STEP 4: Deploy Online
   Option A (Easy - 5 min):
   $ npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   $ Update package.json "homepage" with your GitHub URL
   $ npm run deploy
   
   Option B (Automatic - 10 min):
   Follow GITHUB_SETUP.md for step-by-step GitHub Pages deployment
   Future updates deploy automatically on each push!

================================================================================
THE BUG THAT'S FIXED
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
  Drug-resistant strains never appeared (no red dots)

ROOT CAUSE:
  - Mutation code only created 'MUT' type, never 'RES'
  - Drug resistance mutations were never actually generated
  - Drug selection looked for resistance that didn't exist

SOLUTION:
  - Added drugResistanceMutationRate parameter (1% per generation)
  - Explicit drug resistance mutation pathway
  - Separate mutation check that generates 'RES' type
  - Now drug selection can find and amplify resistance

RESULT:
  ✅ Red dots appear after 10-20 generations
  ✅ Red spreads under drug selection pressure
  ✅ Evolution of antibiotic resistance now visible

See TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md for full code comparison

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

To run locally:
  $ npm install && npm start

To deploy to GitHub Pages:
  $ git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial"
  $ # Create repo on github.com
  $ git remote add origin https://github.com/YOU/outbreak-simulator.git
  $ # Update package.json "homepage"
  $ git push -u origin main

To update live site:
  $ git add . && git commit -m "Changes" && git push
  $ # GitHub Actions deploys automatically in 2-3 min

To understand what's happening:
  $ See TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md

To customize colors/appearance:
  $ Edit tailwind.config.js or src/components/OutbreakSimulator.jsx

================================================================================
WHAT'S DIFFERENT FROM ORIGINAL
================================================================================

Changes made to fix the bug:

1. New parameter: drugResistanceMutationRate (0.01 default)

2. Mutation round enhanced:
   ✓ Added separate if-block for drug resistance
   ✓ Creates 'drug_resistance' mutation explicitly
   ✓ Sets type to 'RES' (not 'MUT')
   ✓ Applies fitness cost

3. Drug selection improved:
   ✓ Can now find resistant individuals
   ✓ Actually triggers when resistance exists
   ✓ Strong pressure: kills wild-type (95%), keeps resistant (90%)

4. Cloning function:
   ✓ Proper handling of Set data structures
   ✓ Consistent throughout all evolutionary steps

Everything else is the same - same 6-step evolutionary process, same UI,
same visualization, same parameters... just actually works now!

I want to run it locally      → Read: QUICKSTART.md

I want to deploy it           → Read: GITHUB_SETUP.md

I want to understand the code → Read: TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md

I'm getting errors            → Check: Browser console (F12)
                               Check: Package.json homepage URL

I want to customize it        → Edit: src/components/OutbreakSimulator.jsx
                               Edit: tailwind.config.js

I see red dots but simulation → Try increasing drugResistanceMutationRate
isn't working as expected       Try running longer (30+ generations)
                               Check browser console for errors

My GitHub Pages isn't working → Did you update package.json "homepage"?
                               Did you wait 2-3 minutes for rebuild?
                               Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

I want to modify parameters   → Open app → Click "Advanced Parameters"
                               Sliders adjust: mutationRate, drugPressure, etc.

I want to change colors       → Edit: getColor() function in OutbreakSimulator.jsx
                               Or edit Tailwind colors in tailwind.config.js

I want to add features        → The code is modular!
                               Each evolutionary step is a separate function
                               Well-commented throughout
